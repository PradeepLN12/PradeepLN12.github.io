Robert J. Sternberg's Investment and Confluence theory posits that creativity is a complex interaction between individual factors and environmental conditions. It suggests that creativity is not an innate trait but rather a skill that can be developed through a combination of factors.

**Key Components Investment:**
 This refers to the resources an individual commits to a creative endeavor. 
 
 These resources can include:

**Time:** The amount of effort and dedication invested in a creative project.

**Energy:** The physical and mental energy expended on a creative task.

**Effort:** The level of commitment and persistence shown in pursuing creative goals.

**Motivation:** The intrinsic drive and passion that fuels creative activity.
Confluence: This refers to the convergence of multiple factors that contribute to creativity. These factors include:

**Intellectual abilities:** Cognitive skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and divergent thinking.

**Knowledge:** The body of information and expertise related to a creative field.
Styles of thinking: The cognitive strategies and approaches used in creative problem-solving.

**Personality traits:** Characteristics such as openness to experience, risk-taking, and nonconformity.

**Environment:** The social, cultural, and physical context in which creativity occurs.
How They Intersect
The Investment and Confluence theory suggests that creativity is most likely to occur when there is a high level of both investment and confluence. In other words, individuals who are highly motivated, persistent, and have the necessary intellectual abilities, knowledge, and personality traits are more likely to be creative, especially when they are in supportive and stimulating environments.

***Example:*** A talented artist may have the necessary intellectual abilities and knowledge, but without the investment of time, energy, and effort, their creativity may remain untapped. Conversely, a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to be creative may lack the necessary skills or resources to fully express their ideas.

**Implications**
The Investment and Confluence theory has several implications for understanding and fostering creativity:

Creativity is not innate. It can be developed through deliberate effort and investment.
Multiple factors contribute to creativity: Both individual characteristics and environmental factors play a role.

Providing individuals with the resources, opportunities, and encouragement they need to pursue their creative endeavors can significantly enhance their creativity.
It involves a series of steps, including idea generation, problem-solving, and implementation.
By understanding the Investment and Confluence theory, we can better appreciate the complexities of creativity and develop strategies to nurture it in ourselves and others.
{% comment %} This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:

![Crepe]({{ '/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }}){% endcomment %}
