With extensive experience in Technical Writing, I stumbled upon User Experience Research one day at my job. The encounter made me curious to learn more about User Psychology, so I started taking baby steps in the field.

Fast forward >> I'm pursuing a Masters in Psychology.

If I were a system, I could say I'm programmed to be a set of {variables}:
- {Technical Writer}
- {Instructional Designer}
- {User Experience Researcher}
- {Budding Mentalist}
- {Aspiring Psychologist}
- {Offbeat Traveler}

With a constant =  *Forever learning!*
